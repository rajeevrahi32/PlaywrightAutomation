# PlaywrightAutomation
This test framework is created using POM design pattern and tests are written using Typescript as a programming language.
We have taken [openhrm](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/auth/login) as test subject and the below scenario is automated:

1. Navigate to https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/index.php
2. Log in as Admin
3. Add new employee (PIM &gt; Add Employee)
4. Fill-in few Personal Details and attach a document.
5. Save the employee details
6. Navigate back to home screen and search with newly created employee
details(PIMïƒ Employee List)
7. verify the personal details of the Employee.
8. create multiple employees using test data file.
9. create a basic report after execution.
